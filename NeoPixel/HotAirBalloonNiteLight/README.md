The hot air balloon night light has four modes. Typically, the left potentiometer (knob) controls the hue (color) of the light and the right potentiometer controls the brightness; however, this is dependent on the night light's mode. To set the mode, press the red button. The button will flash to indicate which mode it's in (e.g., two flashes mean the night light just got set to Mode 2).

1. **Mode 1: Auto-on/off**. By default, when you first plug in the night light, we enter Mode 1. Here, the night light turns on automatically when it's dark and the left knob controls color and the right controls brightness.

2. **Mode 2: Auto brightness**. Similar to Mode 1 but brightness is proportional to how dark the room is (but can still be tweaked by the right knob).

3. **Mode 3: Always on**. Is always on. Ignores the ambient light.

4. **Mode 4: Cross-fade**. Is also always on but automatically cross fades across colors. Here, the left knob controls the speed of how quickly colors change
