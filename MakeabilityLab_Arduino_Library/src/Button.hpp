/**
 * Provides a Button class to handle debouncing and other basic button niceties. 
 * 
 * There are lots of wonderful button classes for Arduino. For a relatively recent 
 * breakdown, see this Stack Overflow post: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/80857/63793.
 * However, all of these libraries are external. Sometimes, I just want to rely on my own code
 * and import as few as libraries as possible. 
 * 
 * A few well-designed libraries that I also took inspiration from:
 *  - https://github.com/avandalen/avdweb_Switch
 *  - https://github.com/evert-arias/EasyButton
 *  - https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button
